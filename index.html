        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He
            is the son of William H. Gates Sr. (1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell
            Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, and
            Irish/Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother
            served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and
            the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W.
            Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi
            (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his
            name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey"
            (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix. The family
            lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged
            by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to
            pursue a law career. When he was young, his family regularly
            attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a
            Protestant Reformed denomination. Gates was small for his age and
            was bullied as a child. The family encouraged competition; one
            visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or
            pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for
            winning and there was always a penalty for losing".
          </p>
          <p>
            At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, where he
            wrote his first software program. When he was in the eighth grade,
            the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's
            rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of
            computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.
            Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he
            was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his
            first computer program on this machine, an implementation of
            tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer.
            Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute
            software code perfectly. After the Mothers Club donation was
            exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including
            DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging
            to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen,
            Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent
            Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the
            operating system to obtain free computer time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make
            money. At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's
            software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the
            system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and
            studied source code for various programs that ran on the system,
            including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with
            CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to
            automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them
            computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in
            order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the
            end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing
            accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of
            his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the
            system for Lakeside.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make
            traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. In 1972, he
            served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives. He
            was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School
            in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests
            (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973. He
            chose a pre-law major but took mathematics (including Math 55) and
            graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard, he met
            fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years
            while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later,
            Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that
            position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one
            of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class
            by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the
            fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by
            only 2%. His solution was formalized and published in collaboration
            with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at
            Honeywell during the summer of 1974. In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800
            was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw
            the opportunity to start their own computer software company. Gates
            dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive
            of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company. He
            explained his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked
            out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave."
